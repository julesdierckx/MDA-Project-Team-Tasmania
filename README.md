Project Modern Data Analytics Code Team Tasmania (2022-2023)

Team members: Jules Dierckx

Folder 1.CodeBeforeApp contains the code (Jupyter Notebook) of the analysis (without app creation) as well as the datasets used. 
The code makes use of the original datasets in the exact same names as the initial sources ('LC2022Q1.csv', 'LC2022Q2.csv',... and 'csv_results_xx_255439_mp-01-naamsestraat-35-maxim.csv', 'csv_results_xx_255440_mp-02-naamsestraat-57-xior.csv', 'csv_results_xx_255441_mp-03-naamsestraat-62-taste.csv',...)
It also makes use of the following datasetes which are added: 'coronavirus_measures_2020-2022.xlsx' and 'results_gscv.xlsx'.
The 'results_gscv.xlsx' dataset is used to have the same reproducable gridsearch results as in the analysis of the report and presentation, which is needed for creating graphs further in the code (for example to keep graph annotations aligned with the results).

Folder 2.App contains the code to create the app and the dataset 'test_set.xlsx' created in the last two lines of code in the first folder (where it is commented out), which is used for the app.
